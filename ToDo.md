# TODO LIST #
Anywhereindb has small numbers of user using it. they found this very useful. some of people have written a blog about it. I think, Anywhereindb should have some extra features. So, let plan for a todo list.

# List #

  * Deployment version: most of the user want use this on deployed server. We will have another version. Admin have to select the tables they want which will be searched by the users.

  * very big tables have only one scroll in the bottom, that very hard to use. we will update that. ASAP. (pointed out by, http://www.rarst.net/script/anywhereindb/ )


  * all the bloggers shared this on there blog we have to thank them in the thank you page.

Please add any suggestion, comment or anything todo in the comment.
thank you,
